Instructions for the game:

- Type a letter of the alphabet to create the corresponding marker at a random position, moving in a random direction.  Typing 'a' gives you an ant, typing 'b' gives you a butterfly, typing 'c' gives you a camel and so on.
- Type '+' to speed up all existing markers, and '-' to slow them down.
- Type '.' to freeze everything, and '.' again to unfreeze.
